# ‚úàÔ∏è Linear Algebra for UAV Applications

Welcome to my curated learning series on **Linear Algebra**, built specifically for real-world applications in **UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles)**. This repo covers essential linear algebra concepts with an application-first approach, tying math theory directly to drone navigation, control, sensor fusion, and computer vision.

## üöÄ Why I Made This

As someone preparing for UAV and AI roles, I realized most resources teach Linear Algebra in an abstract way. So I built this repository to **bridge the gap between theory and actual drone-based applications** ‚Äî from rotation matrices to eigenvalue stability checks.
